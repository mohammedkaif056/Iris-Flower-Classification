# Iris-Flower-Classification
 Certainly! When creating a README file for GitHub, it's important to provide clear and concise information about your project. Here's a sample README file tailored for an Iris Flower Classification project on GitHub:  Iris Flower Classification This repository contains code for classifying Iris flowers using various machine learning algorithms.
#Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning problem where we aim to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. In this project, we explore different machine learning algorithms to build predictive models and evaluate their performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is often used for learning and benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It consists of 150 samples with 4 features each: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of Iris flowers, which can be one of three classes: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

Algorithms Used
We explore the following machine learning algorithms for classification:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
k-Nearest Neighbors
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
